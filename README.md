<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Leaderboard <a name="about-project"></a>

This project is a basic implementation of a leaderboard system. Initially, it allows for manual addition of names and scores. However, the objective is to later integrate an API that retrieves the leaderboard data. The project aims to provide a learning experience in asynchronous programming, utilizing promises to handle API calls. By incorporating the API functionality, it demonstrates the practical application of asynchronous programming concepts and the interaction with external services.
